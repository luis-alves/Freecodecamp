# Everything Be True

Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).

## First considerations

Check if 2nd argument of given function when used as key in array of dictionaries
has valid value.

## My way of doing it

1. Series of if statments checking for valid values.
