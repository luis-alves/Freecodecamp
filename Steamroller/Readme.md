Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

## First considerations

I must check for each fibonacci number in a sequence so that it does no exceeds
the number provided in the argument of the function. Also have to check if it
is odd, and if it is I need to add to a total variable.

## My way of doing it

1. Write a function that will output the fibonacci sequence.
2. Write a loop that will increment by 1
2.1. Check if the fibonacci number as reached the given argument number.
2.1.1. If true end Loop
2.1.2. If false check if the value is odd and increment it to a variable.
