# Finders Keepers 

Create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns
the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument).

Here are some helpful links:

* Array.prototype.filter()

## First considerations

Get the first number in a given array that passes the function that is also
passed as an argument.

## My way of doing it

1. Loop through all numbers in given array (1st argument)
2. Check if numbers passes the the given function (2nd argument)
3. Return the firs one that passes point 2
