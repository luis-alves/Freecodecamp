## Warning
Please, do not use this as a way of cheeting. You will not learn anything this way!

## Intro
In this repo tere are some of the exercises with algorithms, that are proposed
to anyone attendingthe online course on frontend dev.
It can be found in this assignment two kinds of files. An `html` and a
`javascript`. The `html` sole purpose is to provide a template to the running
of the `javascript` code.

My environment setup is simply a browser windows with devtools to run the javascript;
Atom IDE to code and I also use `Browser-sync` tool, that is used run a live server.

## Content
The content is divided in three parts:
1. Basic Algorithm Scripting;
2. Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and
3. Advanced Algorithm Scripting.

At the current date which of these groups have the following tests:
