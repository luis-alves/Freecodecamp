## Warning
Please, do not use this as a way of cheating. You will not learn anything this way!

## Intro
In this repo you will find exercises related to the FreeCodeCamp online course.
For each assignment you will find two kinds of files. One `html` and a
`javascript` file. The `html` sole purpose is to provide a template to inject
the `javascript` code.


## Content
The content is divided in three parts:
1. Basic Algorithm Scripting;
2. Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and
3. Advanced Algorithm Scripting.

At the current date each of these groups have the following tests:

**1. Basic Algorithm Scripting**
  * Get Set for our Algorithm Challenges
  * Reverse a String
  * Factorialize a Number
  * Check for Palindromes
  * Find the Longest Word in a String
  * Title Case a Sentence
  * Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
  * Confirm the Ending
  * Repeat a string repeat a string
  * Truncate a string
  * Chunky Monkey
  * Slasher Flick
  * Mutations
  * Falsy Bouncer
  * Seek and Destroy
  * Where do I belong
  * Caesars Cipher

**2. Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**
  * Sum All Numbers in a Range
  * Diff Two Arrays
  * Roman Numeral Converter
  * Wherefore art thou
  * Search and Replace
  * Pig Latin
  * [DNA Pairing](https://github.com/luis-alves/Freecodecamp/tree/master/DNA-Pairing)
  * [Missing letters](https://github.com/luis-alves/Freecodecamp/tree/master/Missing-Letters)
  * [Boo who](https://github.com/luis-alves/Freecodecamp/tree/master/Boo-who)
  * [Sorted Union](https://github.com/luis-alves/Freecodecamp/tree/master/Sorted-Union)
  * Convert HTML Entities
  * Spinal Tap Case
  * Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
  * Sum All Primes
  * Smallest Common Multiple
  * Finders Keepers
  * Drop it
  * Steamroller
  * Binary Agents
  * Everything Be True
  * Arguments Optional

  **3. Advanced Algorithm Scripting**
  * Validate US Telephone Numbers Incomplete
  * Record Collection
  * Symmetric Difference
  * Exact Change
  * Inventory Update
  * No repeats please
  * Make a Person
  * Map the Debris
  * Pairwise
