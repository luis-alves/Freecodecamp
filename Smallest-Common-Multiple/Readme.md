# Smallest Common Multiple

Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be
evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range
between these parameters.

The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in
numerical order.

e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is
evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.

## First considerations



## My way of doing it

1. Create an array that will accommodate all prime numbers.


## Methods used
[See Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)

#### Syntax
`arr.push([element1[, ...[, elementN]]])`

This method is used in array, as a way to insert an new element at the end
of the array. The opposing method is the `pop()`.

#### Example
```
const arr = [];
const a = 'one';
const a = 'two';

const newArr.push(a);
console.log(newArr);

newArr.push(b);
console.log(newArr);


```
output 1: ['a']
output 2: ['a', 'b']
                 ^-------- the char is placed at the end of array
